## Purpose
For Summer II we are designing a classic connect 4 program, and posting design documents along the way.  Following agile principles we will take an iterative approach to build the game. We are following the Model-View-Control design pattern in the development of our application. Features we look to add to our application during development include a title screen with selectable options, a single player mode with varying difficuties against the AI, and a local multiplayer mode that allows for two players on one instance of the app. What we may add in the future is audio and sound fx to the application, and a multiplayer feature where two LAN connected clients can compete against eachother.
