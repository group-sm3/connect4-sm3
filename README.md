## Purpose
For Summer II we are designing a classic connect 4 program, and posting design documents along the way.  Following agile principles we will take an iterative approach to build the game. We are following the Model-View-Control design pattern in the development of our application. Features we look to add to our application during development include a title screen with selectable options, a single player mode with varying difficuties against the AI, and a local multiplayer mode that allows for two players on one instance of the app. What we may add in the future is audio and sound fx to the application, and a multiplayer feature where two LAN connected clients can compete against eachother.

## How to run
The jar file can be located in the target folder. Make sure you are using Java version 12.0.2. Once in the correct path of the jar, the following command can be entered to launch the application:
```shell
$ java -jar connect4-0.1.jar
```
